# User guide


If you have followed the instructions for installation in the first pages of this manual, from within julia, `befwm` can be imported as usual:


```julia
using befwm
```


In this part of the manual, we will walk through the overall design and usage of `befwm`.


Specifically, we will cover how to run simulations, generate random networks, then deal with the output of the simulations.
