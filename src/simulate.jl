"""
**Main simulation loop**

This function takes two mandatory arguments:

- `p` is a `Dict` as returned by `make_parameters`
- `biomass` is a `Array{Float64, 1}` with the initial biomasses of every species

Internally, the function will check that the length of `biomass` matches
with the size of the network.

In addition, the function takes three optional arguments:

- `start` (defaults to 0), the initial time
- `stop` (defaults to 500), the final time
- `steps` (defaults to 5000), the number of internal steps

Note that the value of `steps` is the number of intermediate steps when moving
from `t` to `t+1`. The total number of steps is therefore on the order of
(stop - start) * steps.

Because this results in very large simulations, the function will return
results with a timestep equal to unity.

The `simulate` function returns a `Dict{Symbol, Any}`, with three top-level
keys:

- `:p`, the parameters that were given as input
- `:t`, the timesteps
- `:B`, an `Array{Float64, 2}` with the biomasses

The array of biomasses has one row for each timestep, and one column for
each species.
