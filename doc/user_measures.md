# Measures on output

These functions let you work with the output of the simulations (*i.e.*
the object returned by `simulate`).

## Population variability

In the original paper {{ "brose" | cite }}, population variability is defined
as the average of the negative coefficients of variations of biomasses of
persisting species. This can be measured using the `population_stability`
function.
