# Bio-energetic Food Web Model

The `befwm` package for [Julia][julia] offers an interface to perform
simulation of the bioenergetic model of Yodzis and Innes {{ "yodzis-innes"
| cite }} as applied to food webs {{ "brose" | cite }}.

[julia]: http://julialang.org

The model uses `Sundials.jl` to perform robust and precise numerical
integration.
